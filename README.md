Test Users
---
Here are a few users you can use with our service (or you can sign up and create your own):
```
FORMAT: <username> | <password>
al@email.com | password : 
    This user has a few matches already set up, and other users have already liked Al so you can see what happens when you like someone who has liked you
    
agnes@email.com | password
    This user is a blank slate user with no other user interactions
    
alice@email.com | password
    This user is a blank slate user with no other user interactions
```
